# Circuit Style Hero Canvas

I was playing the game Transistor and was inspired by some of the animations in it. So I decided to try to replicate this in Javascript. The component is a massive mess that I will clean up one day but for now its cool to play with.

A deployed version of the storybook is available here:

To get started quick:
```yarn```
```yarn storybook```

Let me know if you want an npm package of this and I can deploy something.
